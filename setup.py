    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/

    # specification here:

    keywords=["mapping tool", "gene variation", "protein 3D"],  # Optional

    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    # package_dir={'': 'pdbmapper'},  # Optional

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:

    packages=['pdbmapper', 'makeinterfacesdb',
              'makevariantsdb'],  # Required!!!!!

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. If you
    # do not support Python 2, you can simplify this to '>=3.5' or similar, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires='>=3, <4',  # Optional

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    #
    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:

    #   an egg, in the standard distutils sdist format,
    #   a single .py file, or
    #   a VCS repository(Subversion, Mercurial, or Git).

    # The dependency_links option takes the form of a list of URL strings. For
    # example, this will cause a search of the specified page for eggs or
    # source distributions, if the package’s dependencies aren’t already
    # installed

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": ['pdbmapper=pdbmapper.__main__:main',
                            'makeinterfacesdb=makeinterfacesdb.__main__:main',

    # Examples listed include a pattern for specifying where the package tracks
    # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
