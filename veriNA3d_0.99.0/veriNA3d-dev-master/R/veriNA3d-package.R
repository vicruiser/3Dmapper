#' veriNA3d: Structural bioinformatics package for data mining of the PDB.
#'
#' VeriNA3d is an R package for the analysis of Nucleic Acid structural data. 
#' The software was developed on top of bio3d (Grant et al, 2006) with a higher
#' level of abstraction. In addition of single-structure analyses, veriNA3d also
#' implements pipelines to handle whole datasets of mmCIF/PDB structures. As far
#' as we know, no similar software has been previously distributed, thus it aims
#' to fill a gap in the data mining pipelines of PDB structural data analyses.
