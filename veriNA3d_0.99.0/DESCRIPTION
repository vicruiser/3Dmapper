Description: 
 VeriNA3d is an R package for the analysis of Nucleic Acid structural data. 
 The software was developed on top of bio3d (Grant et al, 2006) with a higher 
 level of abstraction. In addition of single-structure analyses, veriNA3d also
 implements pipelines to handle whole datasets of mmCIF/PDB structures. As far
 as we know, no similar software has been previously distributed, thus it aims
 to fill a gap in the data mining pipelines of PDB structural data analyses.
